% Solid mentions
Main goal of the following thesis is to provide an efficient decentralized storage for the LinkedPipes Applications project. The key concepts of the project is to provide the most intuitive and convenient experience to lay users to manipulate and visualize the linked data, that is consequently turned into independent applications visualizing that data, that can be easily shared and published. The social aspects of sharing and publishing visualizers are also important in a sense that organizing people into communities based around certain linked data and consequent applications is another possible feature or a feature for future development of LinkedPipes Applications project. 

\section*{Structure}

In Chapter \ref{chap:num_1}, the overview of the \lpa{} as a component as a decentralized RDF store. In addition to that, the main terminology is described in general. In Chapter \ref{chap:num_2}, is dedicated to description of similar existing solution as an introduction to a statement of \lpa{}. In Chapter \ref{chap:num_3}, we review the main development stack of \lpa{} as well as the motivation for choosing specific technologies and tools.
