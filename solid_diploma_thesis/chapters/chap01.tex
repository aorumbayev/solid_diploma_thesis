\section{The requirements of the project}

LinkedPipes Applications define the following set of requirements: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide a secure decentralized RDF storage for applications made using LPApps.
    \item Give users an ability to control who can access the applications stored within the storage.
    \item Provide a decoupling of data representing the created visualization application from the actual LPApps platform. Which means that the platform should be able to read any application represented in RDF from the storage, and easily load it. That also implies that the storage can be interchangeable. 
\end{itemize}

A detailed overview of the solution as well as the overview of current alternatives to \solid is provided in the consecutive chapters of this thesis.
